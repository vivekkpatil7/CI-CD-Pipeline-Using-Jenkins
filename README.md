 [Project Link]()

#### Overview

CI-CD Java Pipeline Using Jenkins is a robust continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for Java applications. This pipeline automates the entire software development lifecycle, from source code management to deployment, ensuring a seamless and efficient process.


#### Key Components

- Jenkins: Automation server orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline.
- Maven: Build tool for Java projects, handling project dependencies and building lifecycles.
- SonarQube: Static code analysis tool for continuous inspection of code quality.
- Docker: Containerization platform for packaging applications and their dependencies.
- Tomcat: Web application server for deploying Java-based web applications.
- Slack: Communication platform for real-time notifications and collaboration.
- OWASP Dependency-Check: Security tool for identifying project dependencies with known vulnerabilities.

#### CI/CD Workflow

- Code Checkout: The pipeline starts by checking out the latest code from the version control system.
- Build: Maven is used to compile the source code, run tests, and create executable artifacts.
- Code Quality Analysis: SonarQube performs static code analysis to ensure code quality and security.
- Dockerization: The application is containerized using Docker for consistency across environments.
- Docker Image Push: The Docker image is pushed to a container registry for deployment.
- Deployment: The application is deployed to Tomcat, providing a production-ready environment.
- Slack Notifications: Real-time notifications are sent to Slack channels to keep the team informed.
- Security Check: OWASP Dependency Check is used to identify and mitigate known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
